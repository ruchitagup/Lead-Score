# Lead-Score
Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads.
Business Objective: 
➢ To help X Education select the most promising leads with likely conversion rate of ~80%
➢ To build a model to assign a lead score to each of the leads, such that customers with high lead score are hot leads i.e they are most likely to convert, and customers with low score means cold leads and not likely to convert

❖ Goal of Data analysis: 

➢ To build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads
➢ To address few more problems presented by the company, which the model should be able to adjust to in case the company’s requirement changes in the future
      During the phase, when more interns are available, they wish to make the lead conversion more aggressive. So, they want almost all of the potential leads (i.e. the customers who have been predicted as 1 by the model) to be converted and hence, want to make phone calls to as much of such people as possible.
      Similarly, at times, there are times when the company reaches its target for a quarter before the deadline. During this time, the company wants the sales team to focus on some new work as well. So, during this time, the company’s aim is to not make phone calls unless it’s extremely necessary, i.e. they want to minimize the rate of useless phone calls.
